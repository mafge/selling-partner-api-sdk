### Getting started

#### Credentials

Before you can use the SDK, you need to be registered as a Selling Partner API developer. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [SP-API Registration Overview](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sp-api-registration-overview).
You also need to register your application to get valid credentials to call SP-API. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in [Registering your Application](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-your-application).
If you are already registered successfully, you can find instructions on how to view your credentials in [Viewing your Application Information and Credentials](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/viewing-your-application-information-and-credentials).

#### Minimum requirements

To run the SDK you need dotnet 7.0 or higher.

#### Integrate the SDK

1. Find the latest version number [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/software.amzn.spapi).
2. Add the dependency to your project 


##### NuGet

Add the following lines to the dependencies in your `yourProject.csproj` file:

```xml
  </ItemGroup>
   <ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Yourtest.cs" />
    <PackageReference Include="software.amzn.spapi" Version="1.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

### Use the SDK

In order to call one of the APIs included in the Selling Partner API, you need to:
1. Configure credentials (Note: Use your individual credentials for `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `refreshToken`)
2. Create an instance for a specific API
3. Call an operation

For an example, refer to the following sample code for connecting to Sellers API:
```csharp
// Configure your LWA credentials
LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials
{
    ClientId = "yourClientId",
    ClientSecret = "YourClientSecret",
    RefreshToken = "YourRefreshToken",
    Endpoint = new Uri("https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token")
};

// Create an instance of the Sellers API
SellersApi sellersApi = new SellersApi.Builder()
    .SetLWAAuthorizationCredentials(lwaAuthorizationCredentials)
    .Build();

// Call operation
GetMarketplaceParticipationsResponse result = sellersApi.GetMarketplaceParticipations();
Console.WriteLine(result.ToJson());
```
