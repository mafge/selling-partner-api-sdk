You can call &#x60;getMyFeesEstimateForASIN&#x60; for an item on behalf of a selling partner before the selling partner sets the item&#39;s price. The selling partner can then take estimated fees into account. Each fees request must include an original identifier. This identifier is included in the fees estimate so you can correlate a fees estimate with the original request.  **Note:** This identifier value is used to identify an estimate. Actual costs may vary. Search \&quot;fees\&quot; in [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/) and consult the store-specific fee schedule for the most up-to-date information.  **Note:** When using the &#x60;getMyFeesEstimateForASIN&#x60; operation with an ASIN, the fee estimates might be different. This is because these estimates use the item&#39;s catalog size, which might not always match the actual size of the item sent to Amazon.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | - -- - | - -- - | | 1 | 2 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available.

To avoid errors with SKUs when encoding URLs, refer to [URL Encoding](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/url-encoding).  You can call &#x60;getMyFeesEstimateForSKU&#x60; for an item on behalf of a selling partner before the selling partner sets the item&#39;s price. The selling partner can then take any estimated fees into account. Each fees estimate request must include an original identifier. This identifier is included in the fees estimate so that you can correlate a fees estimate with the original request.  **Note:** This identifier value is used to identify an estimate. Actual costs may vary. Search \&quot;fees\&quot; in [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/) and consult the store-specific fee schedule for the most up-to-date information.  **Note:** When sellers use the &#x60;getMyFeesEstimateForSKU&#x60; operation with their &#x60;SellerSKU&#x60;, they get accurate fees based on real item measurements, but only after they&#39;ve sent their items to Amazon.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | - -- - | - -- - | | 1 | 2 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here.
